# freeCodeCamp Projects

This repository contains my first projects built while following the **freeCodeCamp** curriculum. They are part of my journey to becoming a **DeFi smart contracts developer**, starting from the frontend with basic **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Why I Build These Projects

These projects help me:

- Practice and understand fundamental web development concepts  
- Learn how to structure, style, and bring interactivity to web pages  
- Prepare for my first goal: becoming a **junior frontend developer**

## Projects Included

- **Palindrome Builder** – A simple tool that checks if a word or phrase is a palindrome  
- **Tribute Page** – A tribute to a person I admire, created using semantic HTML and CSS  
- **EVM Documentation Page** – Technical documentation layout built to improve structure and navigation skills

## Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

## My Future Goals

These projects are the first step in my bigger plan. I'm learning JavaScript deeply, then moving into **React**, **Node.js**, **Solidity**, and tools like **Ethers.js** — to ultimately become a **full-stack smart contracts developer** in the **Ethereum ecosystem**.
