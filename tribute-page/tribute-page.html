        <h3>Interesting Facts About Harris as Dumbledore</h3>
        <div id="tribute-info">
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">He Almost Turned It Down</span> – Harris
              initially declined the role <span class="bold">three times</span>!
              He didn’t want to commit to a long film series, but his
              <span class="bold">11-year-old granddaughter</span> convinced him
              to accept, saying she would never speak to him again if he
              refused.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">A Unique Approach to the Character</span> –
              Harris brought a
              <span class="bold">gentle, warm, and wise</span> presence to
              Dumbledore, different from the later portrayal by Michael Gambon.
              His performance made Dumbledore feel more like a
              <span class="bold">caring</span> grandfather rather than just a
              powerful wizard.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">Health Struggles During Filming</span> – While
              filming <span class="italic">Chamber of Secrets</span>, Harris was
              already battling illness. Despite his declining health, he
              insisted on finishing his role to ensure continuity for the fans.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">His Legacy Lives On</span> – Although he passed
              away on <span class="bold">October 25, 2002</span>, before filming
              <span class="italic"
                >Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</span
              >, his portrayal of Dumbledore remains iconic. Many fans still
              consider him the <span class="bold">definitive</span> Dumbledore,
              appreciating his soft-spoken wisdom and kindness.

              Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible
              source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying
              it.
