              The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a decentralized virtual
              environment that executes code consistently and securely across
              all Ethereum nodes. Nodes run the EVM to execute smart contracts,
              using "gas" to measure the computational effort required for
              operations, ensuring efficient resource allocation and network

              The analogy of a
              <span class="highlight">distributed ledger</span> is often used to
              describe blockchains like <span class="bold">Bitcoin</span>, which
              enable a decentralized currency using fundamental tools of
              cryptography. The ledger maintains a record of activity which must
              adhere to a set of rules that govern what someone can and cannot
              do to modify the ledger. For example, a
              <span class="bold">Bitcoin</span> address cannot spend more
              Bitcoin than it has previously received. These rules underpin all
              transactions on <span class="bold">Bitcoin</span> and many other
              blockchains.

              While Ethereum has its own native cryptocurrency (ether) that
              follows almost exactly the same intuitive rules, it also enables a
              much more powerful function:

              all accounts and balances, but a machine state, which can change
              from block to block according to a pre-defined set of rules, and
              which can execute arbitrary machine code. The specific rules of
              changing state from block to block are defined by the EVM.

              computational loops. Payment for computation is made in the form

            <h2 class="EVM-header-two">Introduction to smart contracts</h2>
            <p class="EVM-info">
              A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum
              blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data
              (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum
              blockchain.
            </p>
            <p class="EVM-info">
              Smart contracts are a type of Ethereum account. This means they
              have a balance and can be the target of transactions. However
              they're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the
              network and run as programmed. User accounts can then interact
              with a smart contract by submitting transactions that execute a
              function defined on the smart contract. Smart contracts can define
              rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via
              the code. Smart contracts cannot be deleted by default, and
              interactions with them are irreversible.

            <p class="EVM-info">
              A great aspect about Ethereum is that smart contracts can be
              programmed using relatively developer-friendly languages. If
              you're experienced with Python or any curly-bracket language(opens
              in a new tab), you can find a language with familiar syntax.
